1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
             
                   HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, 
it blocks all the other resources behind it. 

                   In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once 
so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

                  Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data,
of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions 
and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

3.Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address:
IP address:	
The IP address of a device mainly helps in identifying the connection of a network 
(using which the device is connecting to the network).
port:
Port addressing refers to using the port numbers assigned to every process 
to exchange data between .
HTTP methods:
     GET
     Port

It helps us to identify a given device on the available network uniquely.
